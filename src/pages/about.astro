    <p>As a passionate and experienced UI designer, I am dedicated to creating intuitive and engaging user experiences that meet the needs of my clients and their users. I have a strong understanding of design principles and a proficiency in design tools, and I am comfortable working with cross-functional teams to bring projects to fruition. I am confident in my ability to create designs that are both visually appealing and functional, and I am always looking for new challenges and opportunities to grow as a designer.</p>
    <p>My hours are mostly spent as a full-stack product designer at <a href="https://sagara.id/" target="_blank">Xinix Technology</a>, but in my spare time I watch lots of Youtube videos, exercise, listen to RnBs, and last but not least, sleep.</p>
    <p>Currently, Iâ€™m focused on building accessible, human-centered products at Fourth Floor.</p>
